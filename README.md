# EDA Projects

Welcome to my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects** repository! 🚀

This is where I store my small EDA projects, each in its own folder. The goal is to analyze and visualize different datasets, uncovering patterns, trends, and insights in the process. I treat this repo as a learning space where I experiment with data and improve my analytical skills.

## What's Inside?
- 📊 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
- 📈 **Visualizations** – Creating meaningful plots to explore data.
- 📑 **Statistical Insights** – Basic descriptive statistics and correlations.
- 🔍 **Key Findings** – Summarizing the most interesting takeaways from each dataset.

## Why This Repository?
EDA is a crucial first step in any data analysis or machine learning project. This repository helps me practice and refine my skills in **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn**, while also serving as a portfolio of my work.

## How to Navigate?
Each project has its own folder with:
- A **notebook (.ipynb)** containing the code and explanations.
- A **README.md** (if needed) to provide context about the dataset and findings.
- Any relevant **datasets** (if publicly available or linked to a source).

## Tools & Libraries Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook
- 🐼 pandas
- 🔢 numpy
- 📊 matplotlib & seaborn

## Future Plans
I'll keep adding more projects as I explore different datasets. If you have any suggestions or interesting datasets, feel free to share! 

Thanks for stopping by! If you find my work interesting, feel free to ⭐ this repo or check out my other projects on GitHub. Happy analyzing! 📊✨

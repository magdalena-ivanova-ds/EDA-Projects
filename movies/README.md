# Movie Data Analysis & Visualization

## Overview
This project explores a dataset of movies, analyzing key aspects such as income distribution, ratings, duration, and correlations. The goal is to uncover trends and visualize insights using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- Movie income
- Votes and scores
- Directors and their earnings
- Content ratings
- Duration of movies 

For a more detailed look at the dataset, check out [movies.ipynb](https://github.com/magdalena-ivanova-ds/EDA-Projects/blob/main/food_sales/movies.ipynb).

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, wrong data types and values, restructuring the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights through descriptive statistics.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Bar chart of top 5 highest-earning directors
  - Scatter plot of votes vs. scores
  - Pie chart of content ratings distribution
  - Correlation heatmap of key metrics
  - Line plot of total movie income by country
  - Line plot of total movie income by genre
  - Histogram of number of movies produced by country

## Key Insights
- Certain directors have consistently high-revenue movies.
- Higher-rated movies tend to receive more votes.
- Some content ratings are significantly more common than others.
